          HomeEase was founded in 2018 with a simple mission: to make professional home services accessible, reliable, and stress-free for everyone. We saw how difficult it was for homeowners to find trustworthy service providers, and we knew there had to be a better way.

         What started as a small team in San Francisco has grown into a nationwide network of vetted professionals serving thousands of homes every day. We've built our reputation on trust, quality, and exceptional customer service.
